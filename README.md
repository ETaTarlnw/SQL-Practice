# My SQL practice
I use dataset and questions from https://datayolk.net/data/sql-challenge-1/ (Datayolk) for praticing. 

The dataset is about sales of a supermaket that include Customers, Orders, Order_Details, and Payments table.

Skills that I recieve from this practice are SELECT, filter, sort, aggregte data, JOIN and temptable.
